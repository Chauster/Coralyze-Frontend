                        <p>
                            Coralyze’ primary focus is to provide the user with a portable and affordable facial
                            recognition software system through the means of using a TPU (tensor
                            processing unit) device. In the case of INJECT DevOps project, the team was
                            assigned a specific device known as ‘Tinker Edge T’, programmed with machine
                            learning algorithms to effectively identify human gender and age based on
                            certain facial features present on individuals. The idea is to allow the TPU device to
                            be accessed through a web server (host device), to provide a simple interface to
                            monitor and observe individuals in specific environments.

                <h3>Features</h3>
                    <article>
                    <h4>AI Accelerator</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tinker Edge T is a single-board computer (SBC) specially designed for AI applications. 
                            It features the Google Edge TPU, a machine learning (ML) accelerator that speeds up processing efficiency, 
                            lowers power demands and makes it easier to build connected devices and intelligent applications. With this 
                            onboard ML accelerator, Tinker Edge T is capable of performing four tera-operations per second (TOPS) 
                            using only 0.5 watts per unit of computation. It is also optimized for TensorFlow Lite models, making it 
                            easy to compile and run common ML models.
                        </p>
                    <h4>NXP i.MX 8M processor</h4>
                        <p>
                            With its powerful and modern quad-core ARM-based NXP i.MX 8M processor, Tinker Edge T offers a powerful solution 
                            for graphics, machine vision, video, audio, voice and safety-critical applications. Tinker Edge T features 1 GB 
                            of LPDDR4 dual-channel memory, the 4th generation of low-power DDR DRAM technology, offering faster speeds and 
                            even lower power consumption for improved system performance and efficiency. Tinker Edge T also comes equipped 
                            with an onboard 8 GB eMMC and SD 3.0 interface that offers significantly faster read and write speeds for the OS, 
                            applications and file storage.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Advanced power design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Most SBC motherboards only offer a 15 watt (5V 3A) power design, which can cause device and system instability when 
                            there are multiple connected devices. Other SBCs have power designs that lower the performance of their I/O ports. 
                            Tinker Edge T has a special power design that, together with a DC head power supply, delivers up to 45 watts of power, 
                            enabling stable system operation and full I/O performance, even with multiple connected devices. Additionally, an 
                            exclusive power-protection design activates automatically if the supplied current and voltage change significantly, 
                            effectively protecting the board and all connected devices.
                        </p>
                    <h4>More connectivity options for makers</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tinker Edge T features a rich I/O interface, including one MIPI-DSI connection for displays and touch screens, and 
                            two MIPI-CSI connections for compatible cameras to enable computer vision for applications such as depth measurement, 
                            smart vending machine QR code payment systems and interactive advertising.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Tinker Edge T has a maker-friendly design that offers many carefully considered features to provide a superior experience 
                            for first-time builders and seasoned hobbyists alike. Programmable LEDs let makers develop custom lighting behaviors, such 
                            as system notifications and status indicators, and the color-coded GPIO header makes it easy to recognize respective pin headers.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Tinker Edge T also features a full-size HDMI port, USB Type-A, USB Type-C, gigabit LAN and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for 
                            internet and network connectivity.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Heatsink included</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tinker Edge T includes an active heatsink, which helps improve heat dissipation under heavy loading or in hot ambient environments.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Neural network tools for users</h4>
                        <p>
                            ASUS provides a robust API and SDK that enables users to deploy machine learning models to Tinker Edge T easily for applications 
                            such as image classification and object detection.
                        </p>
                    <h4>OS flash tool*</h4>
                        <p>
                            Tinker Edge T comes with a cross-platform OS flash tool that enables easy OS image flashing to SD cards and USB drives, enabling 
                            you to get your system up and running quickly.
                        </p>
